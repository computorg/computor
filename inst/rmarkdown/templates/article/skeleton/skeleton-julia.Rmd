# Introduction

This document provides a Rmarkdown^[rmarkdown.rstudio.com] template for contributions to the **Computo** Journal. It focuses on the *integration of julia code* (possibly together with R code). Please refer to the generic template `skeleton.Rmd` for general instructions. 


The R package [JuliaCall](https://cran.r-project.org/package=JuliaCall) package [@R-reticulate] includes a julia engine for R Markdown. The examples below are taken from the [Julia in RMarkdown](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/JuliaCall/vignettes/Julia_in_RMarkdown.html) vignette.


# Using Julia

## Use JuliaCall as Julia Engine in R Markdown

To use `JuliaCall` package for julia engine in R Markdown document, just
set the language of the code chunk to be `julia`.

```{julia, echo = TRUE}
import Pkg; Pkg.add("Plots")
using Plots
gr(); plot(Plots.fakedata(50,5),w=3)
```

**NOTE: as of Nov 19, 2020 the plot does not show up on the rendered document, see [Issue #1](https://github.com/computorg/computor/issues/1)**

# Communication between R and julia chunks

All objects created within Julia chunks are available to R using the `julia_eval` function. For example, after defining `a` in julia:

```{julia}
a = sqrt(2);
```

we can access it from R:

```{r}
library("JuliaCall")
julia_eval("a")
```
