# Introduction

The goal of this package is to provide a template for contribution to the **Computo** Journal.

All submission should be made in Rmarkdown. Both `R` and `Python` are natively supported. You may use any other computer language (such as Julia) if you manage to render your Rmarkdown

# References

References are displayed as margin notes. For example, we can cite R here [@R-base].

```{r bib, include=FALSE}
# create a bib file for the R packages used in this document
knitr::write_bib('base', file = 'skeleton.bib')
