# Introduction

This document provides a Rmarkdown^[rmarkdown.rstudio.com] template for contributions to the **Computo** Journal, possibly including R code. Other templates are provided for contributions including python and Julia code:

- Rmarkdown templates to include python *and/or* Julia *and/or* R code: **TODO!**
- Jupyter^[https://jupyter.org/] templates to include python *or* Julia code: **TODO!**

# Distill for R Markdown

This template is based on [Distill for R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) [@allaire2018distill]:

> Distill for R Markdown is a web publishing format optimized for scientific and technical communication. Distill articles include:

> -   Reader-friendly typography that adapts well to mobile devices.
> -   Features essential to technical writing like LaTeX math, citations, and footnotes.
> -   Flexible figure layout options (e.g. displaying figures at a larger width than the article text).
> -   Attractively rendered tables with optional support for pagination.
> -   Support for a wide variety of diagramming tools for illustrating concepts.
> -   The ability to incorporate JavaScript and D3-based interactive visualizations.
> -   A variety of ways to publish articles, including support for publishing collections or articles as a Distill website.

> Distill for R Markdown is based on the [Distill web framework](https://github.com/distillpub/template), which was originally created for use in the Distill Machine Learning Journal. Distill for R Markdown combines the technical authoring features of Distill with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), enabling a fully reproducible workflow based on literate programming.

# Features

The most basic features are described below. For more advanced features, we refer to the  [Distill for R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) documentation.

## RMarkdown

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

To render the document as html, When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

## Mathematical formulae

$\LaTeX$ code is natively supported, which makes it possible to use mathematical formulae:

$$
f(x_1, \dots, x_n; \mu, \sigma^2) = 
\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp{\left(- \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \mu)^2\right)}
$$

## R code

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
knitr::kable(summary(cars))
```

## Python and Julia code

> See dedidated template!  **TODO**

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## References

References are displayed as footnotes using bibtex, e.g. [@computo]. The bibliographic information is automatically retrieved from the `.bib` file specified in the header of this document (here: `skeleton.bib`).
